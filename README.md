# Video-Watching-website
 Website is modeled with HTML & CSS to look like a streaming service viewport where you'd watch an episode of a show. The website is responsive to multiple screen widths up to 600px small. The website is pretty much static, it's just formatting and styling using HTML and CSS. Website also has interactive cover properties with the cursor .
